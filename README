This README file contains information on building the eCockpit solution using Yocto Project

Yocto build setup
============
$: EULA=1 MACHINE=imx8qmmekecockpit DISTRO=fsl-imx-xwayland source ./nxp-setup-ecockpit.sh -b build-ecockpit

Yocto configuration file modifying
============
eCockpit solution is built by default to support Linux on Cortex-A53 for the Instrument Cluster and Android 
on Cortex-A72 for the in-Vehicle Infotainment system. If the desired configuration is Linux for IC and Linux 
for the IVI, the U-boot defconfig for Cortex-A72 must be changed. This can be specified in the local.conf file from the build directory.

UBOOT_CONFIG[a72]= "imx8qm_mek_a72_defconfig"
SRCBRANCH_pn-u-boot-imx-a72= "ecockpit_4.14.98_2.3.4-evs"
SRCREV_pn-u-boot-imx-a72 = "ecockpit_06_03

Image building The image should be built withQt 5 support:
============
$: bitbake fsl-image-qt5
